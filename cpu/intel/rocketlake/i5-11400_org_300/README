How to compile:

%========================================
Intensity benchmark
	Single:
		make MAD_PER_ELEMENT=<M> TYPE=0
	Double:
		make MAD_PER_ELEMENT=<M> TYPE=1
%========================================

How to execute:
./main


1) The kernel issues  1 MUL followed by 1 ADD, M times using AVX instructions.

2) Multicore execution is done using OpenMP.

3) For a given M, the arithmetic intensity of this benchmark is different for single and double.
Single
	intensity = (M * 2 flops) / (4 bytes)
Double
	intensity = (M * 2 flops) / (8 bytes)
